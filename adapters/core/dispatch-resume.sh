# shellcheck shell=bash
# dispatch-resume — relaunch the worker whose worktree you are standing in,
# continuing its own engine session. Reached as `dispatch resume`, which execs
# this binary (dispatch.sh intercepts the subcommand).
#
# Its own file rather than a mode inside dispatch.sh: resume skips the
# issue claim, branch creation, task-document rewrite and new-window paths
# entirely, and re-runs only the gates it names. The shebang and
# `set -euo pipefail` are prepended by writeShellApplication.
#
# writeShellApplication runs shellcheck at build time and fails on a warning,
# so ignore_budget and ignore_map — read only by the gates a later task adds —
# carry an SC2034 waiver at their assignment. Drop the waiver when the reader
# lands; do not widen it to the whole file.
